# Oil Revenue Analysis
Operational revenue analysis of a dataset covering Shell, Chevron, and Total Energies. 

---
## Company Context
This project simulates a 2023 upstream production portfolio involving three major international oil companies operating across three producing fields: Agbami, Bonga, and Forcados.

The dataset reflects planned production targets, actual output, downtime events, and operational efficiency metrics across the calendar year. In a capital intensive upstream environment, production variance and downtime directly influence revenue performance and asset profitability.

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate how operational execution across assets translates into financial performance and revenue stability.

---
## Business Questions
- Are assets meeting planned production targets?
- Which fields are driving revenue underperformance?
- How much revenue is lost due to downtime?
- Is production efficiency improving or deteriorating?
- Where is operational risk concentrated?

---
## KPIs
- Total Production (bbl)
- Prodcution Efficiency (%)
- Revenue Loss from Downtime ($)
- Total Revenue ($)

## Operational Insights
### By Company
Chevron achieved 91.3% of production, while Shell and TotalEnergies were at 91.1% and 90.6%, respectively.

### By Field
We had three fields: Agbami, Bonga, and Forcados.

Agbami field had the most revenue loss of 9.4% (~$700M)

### By Time Period 
Production efficiency improved from Q1 to Q4, with a peak perfomance of 91.8% in October

### By Operational Driver (Downtime)
Downtime accounted for 9% of total annual revenue loss for year 2023.

---
## Recommendations
- Focus on fixing fields causing the most revenue loss (Agbami).
- Keep on eye on production efficiency daily to spot dips.
- Review production targets to make sure they match reality on the ground.This is because from what we have here, the annual production did not meet up to the expected production.
