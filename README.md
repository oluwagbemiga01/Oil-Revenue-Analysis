# Oil-Revenue-Analysis
Operational revenue analysis of a dataset covering Shell, Chevron, and Total Energies. 

# Company Context
This project simulates a 2023 upstream production portfolio involving three major international oil companies operating across three producing fields: Agbami, Bonga, and Forcados.

The dataset reflects planned production targets, actual output, downtime events, and operational efficiency metrics across the calendar year. In a capital intensive upstream environment, production variance and downtime directly influence revenue performance and asset profitability.

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate how operational execution across assets translates into financial performance and revenue stability.
